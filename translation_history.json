    "text": "You asked for a simple text, so here’s a clear and easy-to-read explanation about a general topic: the importance of drinking water. Water is essential for life. Every cell in our body needs water to work properly. It helps keep us hydrated, regulates body temperature, and supports digestion. Drinking enough water can improve how you feel and keep your skin healthy. It’s recommended to drink about eight glasses of water each day, but this amount can vary depending on your activity level and the weather. Carrying a water bottle and sipping water throughout the day is a great habit. Remember, sometimes thirst is a sign your body already needs water, so don’t wait too long to drink. Staying hydrated is a simple way to stay healthy and feel good every day.",
